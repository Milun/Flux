Flux

Date: 2/Dec/2013


Description:

The object of the game is to defeat your opponents. To do this, you must ensure they have no counters
left on the board before a "Flux".


Turns:

Each player takes turns placing counters onto the board, moving, or attacking.
At the end of the last players turn, the game will "Flux", and all counters on the board will gain one
health.
If a counter exceeds its maximum health (5), a "Flux" will make it reach "Critical Flux", and its
health will drop to 1.


Placing:

A player may move a single inactive counter onto an empty tile on the board during their turn.
To do so, the player selects the counter with Left-Click, then Left-Clicks the empty
tile they wish to place their counter on.


Moving:

A player may move a single counter already on the board to a neighbouring tile during their turn.
To do so, they Left-Click the counter they wish to move, then Left-Click again on a neighbouring tile to move it.

The player may press Right-Click before selecting the new tile to split the moved tile into two, with the
number displayed on the Ghost Tile indicating the health of the new counter, as well as how much health the
old counter will lose.


Attacking:

To attack another (opponents) counter, the defending counter must have less health than the attacker
for it to succeed.

Simply Left-Click the counter you own that you wish to attack, then left click on an opponents counter
on a neighbouring tile to attack it.


Stalemate:

If, when it reaches a players turn they can't make any valid moves, they will lose the game (regardless
of if they still had counters on the board).
